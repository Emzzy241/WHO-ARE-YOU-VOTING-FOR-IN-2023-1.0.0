<!-- the first line of code above tells the compiler we are using a "Microsoft.NET.Sdk", a software development Kit
which contains the C# language and many libraries of information -->
<!-- the next line of code we tell the runtime that we would like an executable, or Exe output; meaning a program that can be run -->
<!-- Finrally in the TargetFramework tag, we specify that we will be using the .net6.0 framework, which contains a lot of our code libraries -->
